### A few interesting lines of codes

#### My Flutter packages
- [unwired][unwired] Library for simplifying **http (authenticated/unauthenticated) network call functions**. This makes http call and does response parsing on a **dedicated isolate**, lifting heavy work from main thread.
- [otp widget][otp] Flutter Widget for entering OTP with nice flexibility in UI. Widget takes in simple ```TextEditingController``` and binds it to all the individual text fields for OTP digits.

#### Random projects
- [libman][libman] A simple **C application** as inventory management system. Not developed to scale for real world use, but to learn and practice **pointers**, **file handling** and **memory management** in C. In this project, I tried to incorporate a basic event handling system using **functions running in infinite for loop**. 
- [chat-lo][chat-lo] Baby level project on **Socket Programming**. A local chat console application that sends msgs on **UDP protocol**. Uses **mutli-threading** to simultaneously listen to incoming messages while taking inputs from user for sending messages.
- [acclr-mock-device-driver][mockdriver] A mock **device driver** that generates and sends random accelerometer data from **kernel space** to **user space** through buffers.
- [Flutt-Chat][fluttchat] A simple **Flutter app** with **Beautiful Login UI**, built on **Firebase**.
- [RedditAndroid][reddit] An **Android App** that uses Reddit APIs to load data. Uses **MVVM architecture** with **RxJava**, **Dagger2** (Dependency Injection), **Room** and **Retrofit**.
