### My Projects
#### If you are interested into my efforts towards learning 
- [chat-lo][chat-lo] Baby level project on Socket Programming. A local chat console application that sends msgs on UDP protocol. Uses mutli-threading to simultaneously listen to incoming messages while taking inputs from user for sending messages.
- [libman][libman] A simple C application as inventory management system. Not developed to scale for real world use, but to learn and practice pointers, file handling and memory managment in C. In this project, I tried to incorporate a basic event handling system using functions running in infinite for loop. 
- [acclr-mock-device-driver][mockdriver] A mock device driver that generates and sends random accelerometer data from kernel space to user space through buffers. Another repository on my Github uses IOCTL to communicate with userspace.
- [Flutter-Network-Client_Boilerplate][netclient] Boilerplate code for simplifying http (authenticated) network call functions. Check Flutter-Network-Client-Boilerplate-2 for better solution with support of json parsing and model classes as response return (Under Development). 
- [Flutt-Chat][fluttchat] A simple Flutter app with Beautiful Login UI, built on Firebase.
- [RedditAndroid][reddit] An Android App that uses Reddit APIs to load data. Uses MVVM architecture with RxJava, Dagger2 (Dependency Injection), Room and Retrofit. Goal was to learn basic Unit Testing in software development.
